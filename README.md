# UWB-Positioning-Based-on-TOF
This is a TOF-based UWB positioning system constructed in Matlab.
The file "TOFcode" is the base version. "TOFcodefe" optimizes the ranging accuracy by using the GDOP value. 
"TOFcodegdop" integrates the GDOP calculation into the positioning process. 
"TOFcodemulti" realizes multi-base station and multi-tag (trajectory) positioning. 
"TOFcodermse" calculates the RMSE for the entire positioning process.
Among them, "UKF.m" refers to:
